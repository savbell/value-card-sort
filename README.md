# ðŸŽ¯ðŸ“‚ Value Card Sort

## Overview

Value Card Sort is a web-based tool that helps users sort value cards into categories based on their importance. The application is inspired by the works of William R. Miller, Janet C'de Baca, Daniel B. Matthews, and Paula Wilbourne.

With this tool, users can drag and drop value cards into categories, generate a shareable URL of their sorted values, and reset their sorting. It's a handy tool for personal reflection, team exercises, or educational purposes.

## Features

- **URL Generation**: Generate a shareable URL with your sorted values that can be copied or shared.
